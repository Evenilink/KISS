### Software Testability and Reviews
* Testability: the change to expose a fault/bug through tests.
* Controllability: affecting the behavior of the software, with how much work can we provide a program with the right and needed inputs for testing that will affect his behavior.
* Observability: how easy it is for developers to observe the software behavior, more specificly, his outputs, and his response to the tests.
* Isolateability: how deep can the developers test a specific component isolated from all the other components, in other words, how much specific can we get to test that component.
* Separation of Concerns: how specific is the component which we want to test, the degree level of his responsibilities.
* Understandability: how good a component under test is documented.
* Heterogeneity: using diverse technologies, how deep are the test methods and required tools in order to be testable using those technologies.


### Test Statictics and Analystic:
	We stated our project didn’t have tests implemented. As such, the projects doesn’t have the information about the number of test cases, percentage of coverage or number of flaky tests.
	We’re going to try and provide a viable way to implement unit tests in the project.
